# BeamerThemeUoB
This is a (unofficial) Beamer Theme based on the official Powerpoint template for University of Bristols presentations, available here: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/style-guides/print/

Just copy **logo.eps** **beamercolorthemeUoB.sty** **beamerouterthemeUoB.sty** and **beamerthemeUoB.sty** to your project directory and then add this line to your main .tex:

        \usetheme{UoB}

The file test.tex gives a small example of how to use the theme.

For lualatex and xelatex users, the additional feature of using the official University of Bristol font is available.
